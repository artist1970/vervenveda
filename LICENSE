🔒 Privacy & Safety for Pearls’ Palette
​
1. Parental Consent System (Required)
Before any child can:

Submit artwork

Join workshops

Participate in creative challenges

Access chat or community spaces​

a parent or legal guardian must provide consent.

Consent may be completed through:

A signed parental permission form (uploaded or emailed), or

Account creation by the parent using their own verified email

​

This fulfills U.S. COPPA safeguards and EU GDPR-K child data requirements.

​

2. Limited Data Collection (Minimal + Purpose-Based)
To keep children safe, Pearls’ Palette collects only what is necessary, such as:

A first name or artist nickname

Age group (not exact birthday)

Parent/guardian email

Child’s art submissions (optional)

​

We never collect:
❌ Full addresses
❌ Phone numbers
❌ Photos that identify a location
❌ Sensitive information

All submissions remain optional, and parents may review everything.

​

3. Safe Interaction Rules (Protected by Design)
✔ Moderated Communication
Children do not have open private messaging.
All community interactions happen in a supervised, child-safe environment filtered by adult moderators and protective AI.

✔ Zero Personal Information Policy
Visible rules every child must understand:
“Never share your last name, address, school, or phone number.”

✔ Report & Review Tools
Parents and children can:

Flag any artwork, comment, or message

Notify moderators of concerns

Request content removal

Safety is a community effort — and we take it seriously.

​

4. Parents’ Rights & Controls
Parents always remain in control. They may:

Review any artwork, submissions, or messages

Edit or request correction of stored information

Delete their child’s data or artwork

Deactivate their child's account at any time

Simply email KhaemenesAcademy@protonmail.com for any request.
We respond with respect and urgency.

​

5. Pearls’ Palette Child Privacy Policy Add-On
Pearls’ Palette is a creative community designed for minors under 18.
We honor children’s safety, privacy, and emotional well-being.

We commit to:
Requiring parental consent before collecting or displaying any child’s information or artwork

Collecting only limited, non-identifying data

Moderating all communications and submissions

Educating children on safe online behavior

Allowing parents full rights to review or delete data

Children are encouraged to express themselves creatively —
never to share private or personal information.
